# üöÄ Deployment Guide for OpenAI Codex

## GitHub Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `jenny-romantic-songs`
3. Description: `üíï Beautiful TIDAL playlist web app with Netlify serverless functions - Ready for OpenAI Codex development`
4. Make it **Public**
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
cd jenny-romantic-songs
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jenny-romantic-songs.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Environment Setup for OpenAI Codex

### Required Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):
```env
TIDAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
TIDAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
TIDAL_PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id_here
```

### TIDAL API Credentials
Get these from: https://developer.tidal.com/
- Sign up for TIDAL Developer account
- Create a new application
- Copy Client ID and Client Secret
- Note: Current credentials have tier limitations

## Local Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npx netlify dev

# Test functions directly
node netlify/functions/auth-tidal.js
node netlify/functions/get-playlist.js

# Access the app
open http://localhost:8888
```

## Netlify Deployment

### Option 1: Connect GitHub Repository
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `public`
5. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard

### Option 2: Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify init
netlify deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Project Status for OpenAI Codex

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Complete serverless architecture
- Beautiful responsive frontend
- OAuth2 authentication flow
- CORS-enabled API endpoints
- Error handling and caching
- Local development environment

### üéØ Immediate Development Opportunities
1. **Mock Data Mode**: Implement fallback when TIDAL API is limited
2. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Add animations, loading states, search
3. **Music Player**: Basic audio playback functionality
4. **Time-based Features**: Morning/evening song recommendations
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile optimizations

### üîß Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build process needed)
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (Node.js)
- **API**: TIDAL Web API with OAuth2
- **Deployment**: Netlify (serverless)
- **Environment**: All configs in .env

## Quick Start Checklist for OpenAI Codex

- [ ] Clone/fork the repository
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Add your TIDAL API credentials (or use mock data)
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Run `npx netlify dev`
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:8888
- [ ] Start developing new features!

## üë©‚Äçüíª Guide for New Developers

### Official vs¬†Unofficial APIs  
Beginning developers should start with the **official TIDAL Developer Platform** to ensure long‚Äëterm viability and compliance. Although the current feature set is smaller, the portal offers clear docs, a dashboard for managing apps, and SDK examples that make integration straightforward.

If you only need to experiment or build a quick personal hack, unofficial Python/JS wrappers can be useful. Just keep in mind that these libraries reverse‚Äëengineer private endpoints; they may break without notice and cannot be used in production apps that target the App¬†Store or Google¬†Play.

| Path | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Official Platform** | ‚Ä¢ OAuth¬†2.1 compliant<br>‚Ä¢ Clear rate‚Äëlimits & ToS<br>‚Ä¢ Backed by TIDAL support | ‚Ä¢ Feature‚Äëgated tiers<br>‚Ä¢ Some endpoints (streams, user data) still missing |
| **Unofficial SDKs** | ‚Ä¢ Full catalog & stream URLs today<br>‚Ä¢ Great learning playground | ‚Ä¢ Fragile (can vanish with one TIDAL update)<br>‚Ä¢ Violates ToS for commercial use |

### Platform Evolution¬†üöÄ  
TIDAL has publicly committed to expanding its platform through **2024‚Äë2025**, including:<br>
‚Ä¢ User‚Äëlibrary reads (playlists, favourites) ‚Ä¢ 30‚Äësecond preview playback ‚Ä¢ Search & recommendations endpoints ‚Ä¢ Web & mobile playback widgets.

Watching the **developer blog** and the¬†[tida‚Äësdk¬†repos](https://github.com/tidal-music) is the best way to track new drops; the community often opens issues/PRs with workarounds and examples within hours.

### Suggested Next¬†Steps
1. Create your app in the dashboard and save the *Client¬†ID / Secret*.  
2. Add scopes you need (e.g. `playlists.read`) and follow the **authorization‚Äëcode** flow described in the official docs.  
3. Keep a fallback ‚Äúmock‚Äëdata‚Äù mode for local development so your UI works even if you hit tier limits.  
4. Subscribe to the *#tidal-api* channel on Discord/Slack (community‚Äërun) to get early heads‚Äëup on platform changes.
